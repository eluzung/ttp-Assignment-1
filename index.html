      <h2>Impacts of the Wildfires</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some of the impacts of the Canadian wildfires on New York:

        Poor air quality: The smoke from the wildfires caused hazy conditions and poor air quality in many parts of New York. The AQI reached unhealthy levels in many areas, and officials urged residents to stay indoors. The smoke also caused respiratory problems for some people, including asthmatics and people with other lung conditions.
        Flight cancellations and delays: The smoke from the wildfires also caused flight cancellations and delays at New York airports. The smoke made it difficult for pilots to see, and some flights were diverted to other airports.
        Economic impact: The Canadian wildfires also had an economic impact on New York. The smoke caused businesses to close and tourism to decline. The wildfires also damaged property in New York, and the state is expected to spend millions of dollars to clean up the damage.
        The Canadian wildfires are a reminder of the dangers of climate change. As the climate changes, wildfires are becoming more common and more severe. This is a serious threat to New York and other parts of the world. We need to take action to address climate change and reduce the risk of wildfires.
